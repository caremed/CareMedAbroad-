      <h3>4. Step-by-Step Admission Process</h3>
      <p>The MBBS admission process in Kazakhstan is simple and transparent. Students with NEET qualification and valid 12th-grade marks can apply. Once the application is submitted, an invitation letter is issued by the university. After that, visa processing begins. Our team at CareMedAbroad ensures smooth guidance throughout the journey, from documentation to travel and settling in Kazakhstan.</p>

      <h3>5. FMGE & NEXT Preparation Abroad</h3>
      <p>One of the key challenges for Indian students is clearing FMGE/NEXT after completing MBBS abroad. Many Kazakhstan universities collaborate with Indian faculty to provide weekend online classes, question banks, and mock tests. Caspian ISM particularly ensures its Indian students are equipped with the right resources to confidently clear licensing exams.</p>
